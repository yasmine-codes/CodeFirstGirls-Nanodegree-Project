* Import SQLAlchemy
* Import flask
* Import flask_login
* Import requests 
* Create .env file in CodeFirstGirls-Nanodegree-Project to add and hide your API_KEY and SECRET_KEY
* db.sqlite text file - If the db.sqlite (not the db.sqlite.py file) text file is empty, please delete that file and run the db.sqlite.py file. This will then produce the correct db.sqlite text file.
