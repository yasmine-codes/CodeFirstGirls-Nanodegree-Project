If the db.sqlite (not the db.sqlite.py file) text file is empty, please delete that file and run the db.sqlite.py file. This will then produce the correct db.sqlite text file.
To run this, please input in the terminal - export FLASK_APP=project export FLASK_DEBUG=1 flask run
After you input that, please sign up (with fake details if you want!) and login.
